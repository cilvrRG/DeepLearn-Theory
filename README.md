# DeepLearn-Theory
Reading Group on Topics on theoretical, mathematical aspects of DL.
NYU, Fall 2016. 

The purpose of this reading group is to define good open problems that relate 
Deep Learning models with aspects of statistics, applied maths and physics.
We are particularly interested in connections with statistical physics, optimization 
and harmonic analysis. Everyone is welcome.

##Information 
Thursdays at 4pm, Center for Data Science, NYU. 60 5th ave, 6th floor. 
##Logistics 
The goal is that each week a designated person will present a selected paper, 
and possibly a bit of the mathematical context that is required to address it. 

##Tentative List of Topics:
  - Statistical Physics, Maximum Entropy and Unsupervised Learning. 
  - Stochastic Optimization and Stability.
  - Gradient Descent, bassins of Attraction and Tensor Analysis.
  - Graph Theory, Invariance Groups and Convolutions.
